### What is Swift? 

Swift is a modern programming language by Apple that is fast, safe and interactive. It is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS & tvOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive and apps run lightning-fast. Swift is ready for your next project — or addition into your current app — because Swift code works side-by-side with Objective-C. Swift is open sourced too at - https://github.com/apple/swift.
