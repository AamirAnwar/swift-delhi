## Test Driven Development

- [Getting Started with TDD in Swift 3](https://medium.com/@ynzc/getting-started-with-tdd-in-swift-2fab3e07204b)

This tutorial will help you write your first TDD app in Swift by building a FizzBuzz game for iOS. Weâ€™ll build it up step-by-step with fun challenges along the way and learn about different aspects of building a mobile app.

- [Why Test-driven Development?](http://derekbarber.ca/blog/2012/03/27/why-test-driven-development/)

Perhaps youâ€™ve heard of test-driven development but donâ€™t really know what it is. Or maybe you know about it but you just donâ€™t know why you would ever want to use it. In this article I hope to give an overview of exactly what test-driven development is and why you should consider integrating it into your software development process.

- [TDD in Swift by writing a program that checks for a prime number](http://rshankar.com/test-driven-development-in-swift/)

Here is a beginner tutorial on TDD in Swift by writing a program that checks for a prime number. We will by creating a new project, selecting template as Single View Application. Though we wonâ€™t be adding anything to the storyboard as we will focus only on the business logic.


## Server Side Swift (Vapor)

- [Exploring Server Side Swift](https://ustwo.com/blog/exploring-server-side-swift)

Beyond simple curiosity or strong preferences for the Swift language, why might you want to build a server with Swift? There are a few reasons that come to mind, but ultimately you need to decide whether they make sense in your context.

While the Swift language makes it easy to write software that is incredibly fast and safe by design, Swift being open source means you can use it on an even broader range of platforms, from mobile devices to the desktop and in the cloud. Come for an overview of available projects at Swift.org and examples of the community in action.

"Can Server-Side Swift beat Node.js"?
Swift as a primary language for everything, including the server, has been intriguing since it was first open sourced and ported to Linux. Many of you are assuredly as curious as I am, so Iâ€™m very pleased to share the results of my study here.

## RxSwift

- [What is Reactive Programming?
](https://medium.com/@kevalpatel2106/what-is-reactive-programming-da37c1611382)

What are the problem we are facing? Why do we require Reactive Programming? Because if there is no problem, then we donâ€™t need a solution right??
In this article, we are going to learn the basic concepts of the Reactive Programming.

- [Functional Reactive Programming in Swift 3

This post is a tutorial that will teach you how to bind data to views using RxSwift, which is a part of the Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) design patternâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhere views react to changes to data. FRP is not MVC.
