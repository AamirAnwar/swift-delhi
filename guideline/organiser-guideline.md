## Swift Delhi Meetup Organiser Guideline

### How to get speakers?

- we should share a google form ideally on the first Monday after a meetup in #delhi channel on our slack group - [sample google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1P77mori3m1a3nJ_oUTT3PTNSyYOKCe00ZUN_ygfIMzQ/viewform?edit_requested=true)
- add rest of the team members on the response google sheet and as editors of the original form
- for next two weeks we should keep an eye on the responses, we atleast need three speakers 
- after two weeks if we still don't have enough responses then share again on #delhi channel
- if we get more than three responses then pick the most diverse topics so that all are different and put rest in queue for the next meetup
- after finalising, we should inform the speakers (you can also create a private group of them) and ask them to start preparing for the slides
- we should ask for the slides atleast one week before the meetup so that we can review them (both technically & content wise)

### How to get office space?

- we should share a google form ideally on the first Monday after a meetup in #delhi channel on our slack group - [sample google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1v3J3WnlD2SNLAjXFrsRkTiw6w62R3PhL6GgAdE8whr4/viewform?edit_requested=true)
- add rest of the team members on the response google sheet and as editors of the original form
- we should wait for a week for the responses and then simply pick one which you think could be the best one (near-metro/easy-transportation)
- contact the person on slack and share our standard request email with him/her and wait for the reponse
- next meetup date should be atleast 4 weeks after the previous one
- once an office is confirmed then share it immediately on #delhi channel

### How to get feedback

- we should share a google form ideally on the first Monday after a meetup in #delhi channel on our slack group - [sample google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sWW0Je1Zi3O7B7aZhw8PWj1WZ9yj2wyxxfdzKRa5lfI/viewform?edit_requested=true)
- add rest of the team members on the response google sheet and as editors of the original form
- we should discuss in #delhi-organiser how we can improve them
- we can also put a note in #delhi channel if somone can prepare on a topic suggested by other developers via feedback form

### Post meetup requirements?

- we should share three google form ideally on the first Monday after a meetup in #delhi channel on our slack group - **speaker** form, **office** form & **feedback** form
- we should upload all the ppts/pdf from the last meetup on speakerdeck within the next week after last meetup (you can contact @ritesh on slack if you don't have access)
- we should upload all the videos from the last meetup on youtube within the next week after last meetup (you can contact @ritesh on slack if you don't have access)

### Pre meetup requirement?

- we need to finalise the speakers within two weeks since the last meetup
- we need to finalise the office space within two weeks since the last meetup
- we should share the meetup page atleast two weeks before the next meetup
- we should share the meetup details on #delhi channel atleast two weeks before the next meetup
- we should review the ppts atleast one week before the next meetup so that the speaker could get some time to make changes (if any)
- keep an eye on #delhi channel for any kind of request/update
- worst case if we don't get three speakers then one of us (organisers) should step-up and do one presentation, it could be light & easy

### Spread the word about meetup?

- before a meetup let's share about it on twitter, facebook and any other relevant media you think is important
