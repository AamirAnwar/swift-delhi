## Swift Delhi Meetup Speaker Guideline

### What are some best practices to follow when preparing a talk?
-  Length of the talk should not exceed 45 minutes. A presentation of around 30 minutes would be ideal.
-  Highlight any required pre-requisite material/topic needed which is essential to better understand the content of your talk.
-  Go over the overview or ‘what you will learn’ in the first few slides of your presentation. (Could be a list of topics you plan to cover)
-  At the end of your presentation provide a brief summary and any resources for further reading about the topic.
-  If possible, a live demonstration with code would be a great addition to your talk.
